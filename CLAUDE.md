# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

A proof-of-concept web scraper that rebuilds the ADCS "ILACS Summary" (Ofsted Children's Social Care inspection results for all English Local Authorities) directly from `reports.ofsted.gov.uk`, on-demand rather than waiting for the periodic ADCS publication. It's a single-script pipeline, not an application with a framework — code readability/hackability was prioritised over architecture, and the script has grown organically to handle inconsistencies in the source data.

Published output: https://data-to-insight.github.io/ofsted-ilacs-scrape-tool/

## Running the tool

`pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock` is the single source of truth for Python dependencies (there is no separate `requirements.txt` to keep in sync).

```bash
./setup.sh                    # uv sync + graphviz (system dep) + VS Code python ext
# or directly:
uv sync

uv run python ofsted_ilacs_scrape.py # runs the entire scrape -> extract -> enrich -> export pipeline
```

There is no test suite, linter, or build step in this repo — `main.py` is an unrelated uv-scaffold placeholder ("Hello from ofsted-ilacs-scrape-tool!") and is not part of the actual pipeline. Validation of changes is done by running the full script and inspecting `output.log`, the console debug output (`🔍 DEBUG:`/`📊 DEBUG:` prefixed lines), and the generated `index.html` / `.xlsx`.

**System requirement**: `tabula-py` (PDF table extraction) needs a Java runtime (`default-jre`) on PATH — this is installed explicitly in the GitHub Actions workflow and should be present in Codespaces/devcontainer images.

**Runtime**: the script takes ~4m10s for a full run (every LA's most recent PDF is downloaded and parsed for grades/dates). There used to be a `pdf_data_capture` config flag for a faster link-list-only mode, but it was removed — it produced a DataFrame missing columns (`inspector_name`, the grade columns) that the rest of the pipeline (steps 5-8 below) unconditionally assumed existed, so it crashed rather than actually working, and nothing wired it up as a real option (no CLI flag/env var, just a hardcoded constant). If a faster local dev loop is needed again, prefer capping `max_results` (process fewer LAs through the *same* full pipeline) over skipping PDF parsing.

## Architecture / pipeline flow

Everything lives in **`ofsted_ilacs_scrape.py`**, a single ~1510-line top-to-bottom script (config → imports → function defs → sequential execution at module scope — there's no `if __name__ == "__main__"` guard or class structure). Reading it top-to-bottom is reading the pipeline:

1. **Config block (top of file, lines ~1-50)** — output filenames, folder paths (`export_data/`, `import_data/`), inspection duration thresholds used to classify short vs. standard inspections, and the Ofsted search URL/pagination params. Change behaviour here first before touching function bodies.

2. **Scrape** (`get_soup`, `handle_pagination`) — paginates `reports.ofsted.gov.uk` search results (max 100 results/page) to collect every LA provider link.

3. **Per-provider extraction** (`process_provider_links`) — for each LA provider page, finds all published inspection PDFs, identifies "children's services inspection" reports via the link's accessible/nonvisual text (fragile: depends on Ofsted's current markup/wording), downloads the **most recent** PDF's bytes, and writes it under `export_data/inspection_reports/<urn>_<la_name>/`. The call into PDF parsing (step 4) is wrapped in `try/except` — if extraction throws for one LA's PDF, that LA gets logged (`logging.error`, with URN/name/filename) and placeholder `"data_unreadable"` values instead of aborting the whole run.

4. **PDF parsing** (`extract_inspection_data_update`, `fix_invalid_judgement_table_structure`, `fix_misalligned_judgement_table`) — this is the messiest and most change-prone part: pulls inspection dates, inspector name, framework type, and the judgement grades (overall effectiveness, impact of leaders, help & protection, in care, care leavers) out of inconsistently-formatted PDF tables via `tabula`/`PyPDF2`. Ofsted's report layout has changed over time (notably a Jan 2023 summary restructuring — `in_care_grade`/`care_leavers_grade` replace the older combined `care_and_care_leavers_grade`), so this code has version-specific branching and known per-LA extraction bugs (see README "Known Bugs" — southend-on-sea, nottingham, redcar and cleveland, knowsley, stoke-on-trent). If `tabula` finds no table at all, or a report yields fewer grade rows than expected, this degrades to placeholder `"data_unreadable"`/`NaN` values (logged via `logging.warning`) rather than raising — see the `known_judgements`-based placeholder pattern shared across these functions.

5. **Assemble** — results collected into `data` (list of dicts) then `ilacs_inspection_summary_df` (pandas DataFrame). This DataFrame is the pipeline's central object for the rest of the script.

6. **Enrich from flat files** (`import_csv_from_folder`, `merge_and_select_columns`, `reposition_columns`) — joins in `import_data/la_lookup/Provider_data_lookup.csv` (historic LA codes, ONS region identifiers, CMS system) keyed on `urn`. `merge_and_select_columns` left-joins by default and logs (`logging.warning`) any `urn`s with no lookup match, rather than silently dropping them. Geospatial enrichment (`read_json_to_dataframe`, `import_data/geospatial/*.json`, for choropleth/map use) exists but is **commented out / in progress** — LA boundary data doesn't cleanly map to ONS codes yet.

7. **Sentiment analysis** — not part of the active pipeline at all. The functions (`get_sentiment_and_topics`, `get_sentiment_category`, `plot_filtered_topics`, etc.) live in **`admin/sentiment_experiment.py`**, moved out of the main script since they were dead code there (unreachable — every call site was commented out — and would `NameError` on `textblob`/`nltk`/`gensim`, none of which are installed). Kept as reference material for the README's "Future work" section, not imported or run by anything.

8. **Export** (`save_data_update`, `save_to_html`) — writes:
   - `ofsted_csc_ilacs_overview.xlsx` at repo root (full dataset, via `xlsxwriter`, with the `local_link_to_all_inspections` column as an active hyperlink to that LA's downloaded PDFs).
   - `index.html` at repo root (a reduced `column_order` subset for the public GitHub Pages site — see the `column_order` list near the end of the script if adding/removing web-visible fields).

## Output data — what's actually in the table

One row per Local Authority (153 rows currently), keyed on `urn`, describing that LA's **most recent published** ILACS inspection. The `.xlsx` is the full table (20 columns); `index.html` shows a trimmed, presentation-formatted subset (see `column_order`, `ofsted_ilacs_scrape.py:1499`) with hyperlinked report/URN columns and title-cased text.

| Column | Source | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `urn` | scrape | Ofsted's unique provider reference — primary key |
| `la_code`, `region_code`, `la_code_new` | `Provider_data_lookup.csv` (step 6) | historic LA number, ONS region code, current ONS/GSS local authority code |
| `stat_neighbours`, `stat_neighbour_judgement` | `Provider_data_lookup.csv` + `map_neighbour_grades` | that LA's statistical neighbour LA codes, and each neighbour's most recent overall grade — for peer comparison |
| `local_authority` | scrape (`clean_provider_name`) | normalised LA name |
| `inspection_link` | scrape | direct URL to the source PDF on `files.ofsted.gov.uk` (the underlying inspection report) |
| `overall_effectiveness_grade`, `impact_of_leaders_grade`, `help_and_protection_grade`, `in_care_grade`, `care_leavers_grade` | PDF extraction (step 4) | the ILACS judgement grades (`outstanding`/`good`/`requires improvement`/`inadequate`) — `in_care_grade`/`care_leavers_grade` replace the older pre-Jan-2023 combined `care_and_care_leavers_grade` |
| `inspection_framework` | PDF extraction | `short` or `standard`, derived from inspection duration vs. the config thresholds |
| `inspector_name` | PDF extraction | lead inspector, lower-cased/whitespace-normalised for grouping |
| `inspectors_inspections_count` | computed | how many LAs in this run that same inspector has led — a rough workload/coverage indicator, not from the PDF |
| `inspection_start_date`, `inspection_end_date` | PDF extraction | on-site inspection dates |
| `publication_date` | scrape (parsed from the PDF filename) | when Ofsted published the report |
| `local_link_to_all_inspections` | scrape | filesystem path to that LA's folder under `export_data/inspection_reports/` — an active hyperlink in the `.xlsx` only (dropped from `index.html`, since the full PDF archive isn't published to GitHub Pages) |

Sentiment/topic columns (`sentiment_score`, `sentiment_summary`, `main_inspection_topics`, `inspectors_median_sentiment_score`) are referenced by small commented-out breadcrumbs in the main script (marking where the `admin/sentiment_experiment.py` functions would plug back in, see step 7) but are not produced by anything currently — don't expect them in output.

## Key external links

- **Ofsted reports search** (scrape entry point) — `https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/` — `search_url`/`pagination_param` in the config block build the "Local Authority Children's Services" filtered search URL this script paginates.
- **Individual inspection report PDFs** — served from `https://files.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/<id>`; this is what `inspection_link` points to and what gets downloaded into `export_data/inspection_reports/`.
- **ADCS ILACS Outcomes Summary** (the periodic publication this project re-creates on-demand) — `https://adcs.org.uk/inspection/article/ilacs-outcomes-summary`.
- **Published output (GitHub Pages)** — https://data-to-insight.github.io/ofsted-ilacs-scrape-tool/.
- **Smart Cities Concept Model** reference (background for `sccm.yml`) — `https://www.smartcityconceptmodel.com`.

These appear as literal strings in `save_to_html`'s `intro_text`/`disclaimer_text` (`ofsted_ilacs_scrape.py:1165-1180`) and in the config block (`ofsted_ilacs_scrape.py:33`) — update both places if a source URL changes.

### Key data conventions
- **`urn`** (Ofsted's unique provider reference) is the primary join key throughout — always coerced to `int64`/numeric before merges.
- **`la_code`** is the older/historic LA number, brought in via the lookup CSV for backwards-compatible use cases.
- **`la_code_new`** (from the lookup CSV) is the ONS/GSS local authority code shown in the published output (`column_order`) — "new" relative to the older numeric `la_code` scheme it succeeds, not a reference to any particular code vintage. It's kept current on a rolling basis, so it gets updated whenever an LA's code changes (e.g. Barnsley E08000016→E08000038 and Sheffield E08000019→E08000039 from the April 2025 Barnsley and Sheffield (Boundary Change) Order). It's the **sole** ONS-code column in the CSV — `lad23cd`, `ltla23cd`, and `ltla23_ons` used to duplicate the same value and were removed, since keeping several manually in sync invited exactly the kind of drift this column now tracks alone (Barnsley/Sheffield's 2025 codes were caught out of sync in one of these duplicate columns before the consolidation). `admin/check_la_code_currency.py` is a manual, non-CI check for drift against the live ONS dataset. The lookup CSV deliberately keeps rows for defunct historic LAs (e.g. Cumbria, pre-2021 Northamptonshire, Poole) so other LAs' `stat_neighbours_previous` references stay resolvable — these never appear in the scraped output anyway, since that's a left join keyed on currently-scraped `urn`s. Their `la_code_new` holds each one's own last-known/terminated code from just before it was abolished (Cumbria E10000006, Northamptonshire E10000021, Poole E06000029) for historic reference, not a current successor code — Cumbria and Northamptonshire each split into two current LAs with their own new codes (already reflected on those LAs' own rows), and Poole merged into Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (E06000058) rather than keeping its own code, so none of these three defunct codes are joinable to a single current LA today.
- Local authority names are normalised through `clean_provider_name` (lowercased, council/borough/district boilerplate stripped) — apply the same cleaning if adding new name-based joins, or names won't match.
- Per-LA PDF export directories are named `<urn>_<cleaned_la_name>` under `export_data/inspection_reports/`.

### Supporting files (not part of the main pipeline)
- **`admin/generate_sccm_graph.py`** — regenerates `sccm_graph_static.svg` from `sccm.yml` (the Smart City Concept Model entity/relationship graph shown in the README) using `networkx`/`graphviz`. Run manually, not part of the scrape.
- **`sccm.yml`** — source of truth for the SCCM entities/relationships; edit this, then regenerate the SVG, if the conceptual model changes.
- **`admin/validate_scrape_output.py`** — the CI sanity check described under "CI / deployment" below; also runnable manually.
- **`admin/check_la_code_currency.py`** — manual, non-CI check for `Provider_data_lookup.csv`'s `la_code_new` codes going stale against the live ONS Open Geography Portal "Local Authority Districts ... Names and Codes in England" dataset. Not wired into either GitHub Actions workflow — LA boundary changes are rare, government-order-driven events, not worth checking on every daily/PR run. Run manually with `uv run python admin/check_la_code_currency.py`.
- **`admin/sentiment_experiment.py`** — unused reference code for sentiment/topic analysis on inspection PDFs (see step 7 above); not imported by anything.

## CI / deployment

Two workflows, deliberately kept separate:

- **`.github/workflows/gh_refresh_gpage.yml`** ("Daily ILACS Scrape & Deploy") — the publish job. Triggers on `push`/`schedule`/`workflow_dispatch` against `main` (**not** `pull_request` — see below), runs the scraper, commits the refreshed `index.html` + `.xlsx` back to `main`, and deploys `index.html` to GitHub Pages. **Per the README, the scheduled auto-run is not currently working reliably** — the script is being run manually (via Codespaces + `./setup.sh` + running the script + push) as a workaround. If asked to fix "the daily refresh isn't happening," this workflow/schedule is the place to look, not the scrape logic itself.
- **`.github/workflows/pr_check.yml`** ("PR Check - Scrape & Validate") — runs on `pull_request` against `main`. Checks out the PR's own branch (unlike the daily job, which hardcodes `ref: main`), runs the same scrape + validate steps, but never commits or pushes anything. This exists so a PR that breaks the pipeline is actually caught, without touching `main`.

These used to be one workflow with `pull_request` as an extra trigger on the daily job - that always checked out and pushed to `main` regardless of which event fired it, so a PR run tested nothing (it ignored the PR's actual changes) and could race the real push-triggered run: both PR #1 and PR #2's `pull_request`-triggered runs failed with `git push` rejected (`cannot lock ref`/`fetch first`) because `main` had moved on (from the PR being merged) by the time the redundant PR-triggered scrape finished. Split into two workflows to fix this - if this regresses, check that `gh_refresh_gpage.yml` still has no `pull_request` trigger before assuming it's a new bug.

Between the scrape step and the commit-back step (in `gh_refresh_gpage.yml`) or the final step (in `pr_check.yml`), both workflows run `admin/validate_scrape_output.py` — a stdlib-only sanity check (row count, required columns, file sizes) that fails the job rather than publishing/passing an obviously broken scrape. It also checks what fraction of LAs have no real `overall_effectiveness_grade` (still `data_unreadable`/missing): over 10% fails the job (`::error::`, likely a systemic break rather than the usual handful of known per-LA quirks — see README "Known Bugs"), any failures at all emit a `::warning::` GitHub Actions annotation without blocking. Run it manually with `uv run python admin/validate_scrape_output.py` after a local run if you want the same check.

Manual run instructions for non-admin users are in the README ("Script admin notes"): open a Codespace on `main`, run `./setup.sh` (`chmod +x setup.sh` first if permission denied), run `uv run python ofsted_ilacs_scrape.py`, download the refreshed `.xlsx`.

## Known limitations to keep in mind

- The Ofsted site's HTML structure and PDF report layout are moving targets outside this project's control — scrape/parse logic is inherently brittle and may need re-tuning (see the "In progress Ofsted site/search link refactoring" notes near the top of the script for a partially-started URL param refactor).
- Some LAs have PDF encoding/formatting quirks causing specific columns to fail extraction (see README "Known Bugs"); when fixing one, check whether the fix regresses the others, as several fixes have been layered defensively (`fix_invalid_judgement_table_structure`, `fix_misalligned_judgement_table`).
- Geospatial/choropleth mapping and sentiment analysis are both explicitly unfinished — don't assume commented-out code nearby is dead; it's often paused work-in-progress referenced in the README's "Future work" section.
